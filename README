Deploy Instructions
	Mongodb-------------------------------------------------
	to start the mongodb process, database files are in db
	# mongod --dbpath backend/db
	for access to mongodb shell
	$ mongo
	You can also start with a clean db as long as you create the
	collections:
		tags
		imagedata
		accounts
		tokens

	for instructions on how to shutdown the database, see backend/db-notes
	Backend--------------------------------------------------
	It just runs
	# ./backend/backend.py

	Frontend------------------------------------------------
	The front end does not need to be deployed, it is served by 
	the backend

	Access---------------------------------------------------------------
	The app is hosted on localhost:8000, although with port forwarding it
	should work on the open web
