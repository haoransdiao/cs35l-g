This app will let people save their photos to another location. It offers more
options for customization than default, already-installed photos apps on phones.
Instead of putting a photo into an album on their phone, users can decide to tag
a photo with as many relevant ideas as they want. This will let them easily access
memories of events and locations they have visited; in addition, they can look
for photos related to various themes.
