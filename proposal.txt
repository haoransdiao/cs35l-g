# ChromaShare Project Proposal

ChromaShare is an Webapp that allows people to store photos in a better way and share them with their friends. 
It offers more options for customization than default, already-installed photos apps on phones.
Instead of putting a photo into an album on their phone, users can decide to tag
a photo with many relevant tags and then perform advanced searches to find instantly what they're looking for. This will let them easily access
memories of events and locations they have visited; in addition, they can easily search
for photos related to various themes.

# Features:

- Create an account with username and password

- Upload photos (and share them if you'd like)

- Give many tags to a photo

- Search for tags and see related photos 

- Automatically tag photos based on color composition 

- Report inappropriate content 

- Recommend tags based on color histograms photos you shared 

- Add notes to your pictures

- Advanced search pictures by title, notes and color composition.

- Assign the most popular color in each picture 

# Architecture:
## Server written in Python
Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation.
## Storing Data in MongoDB 
MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.
## Webapp written in React 
React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.
## Json API
JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is an encoding scheme that is designed to eliminate the need for an ad-hoc code for each application to communicate with servers that communicate in a defined way.
## Processing images using OpenCV
OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.
