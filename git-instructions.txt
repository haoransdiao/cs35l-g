These are instructions for setting up git on seasnet

1. you need to make a Github Account www.github.com

2. You need to generate an ssh public key. SSH is the program you use to connect
to seasnet, and will be how you connect from seasnet to Github. Github is
annoying and doesn't just accept username and passwords, so you need to make a
key instead.

$ ssh-keygen

keep pressing enter through the prompts, and set a password for the key


3. Then open up ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub You will paste this into Github

$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

or use emacs, your choice

4. Go to Github.com, settings > SSH and GPG Keys > new SSH Key. Paste in what you copied from
id_rsa.pub into the text box.

5. clone the repository. In seasnet, clone with

$ git clone git@github.com:haoransdiao/cs35l-g.git

6. to make a change to the repository do this

git pull
git commit * -m "some message"
git push "this will prompt for the password of the key"
